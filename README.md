# [BTC-USD-Price-Prediction](https://nbviewer.org/github/mjabubakar22/Tech-Portfolio-Analysis/blob/main/Tech%20Stocks%20Portfolio.ipynb)
In this notebook I’m going to try and predict the BTC/USD close price(target/dependant variable) for the month of June 2022 using the linear regression as the chosen model, I will also use a set of relevant independent variables like moving averages, volume, etc

I’ll follow a basic data science workflow from importing data to model development and evaluation.
Lastly, assuming the model passes the validation stage, I will bactest and measure its performance as a trading strategy to further gain insights on how reliable it can be before placing any trade based on the prediction made
